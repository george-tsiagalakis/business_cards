SVG business cards
==================

A set of SVG files I set up for using as my business cards using Inkscape; sweet and simple, edit SVGs to what you need using any vector editing app or text editor for minor tweaks, and use the OpenDocument print template for printing them as 54.0 x 85.6 / ISO 7810 cards.

The code within the SVG and FODT files is released under the GPL v3
